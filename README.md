Aeronautical engineering student at Imperial College London, currently on a year in industry at Siemens, working on CFD software and numerical tools.

Current work:
- Neural networks implemented from first principles (autograd, backpropagation, optimisation)
- Function approximation and generalisation behaviour
- Comparison of classical numerical methods and ML surrogates
- PyTorch used after scratch validation

Projects:
- approx_Sin — neural network approximation of sin(πx) using scratch and PyTorch implementations
- HKJC_ML — noisy real-world data ML pipelines (private)
